---

**Problem Domain:**

Create a RPS game that competes against computer
Create a winner each round
Add point to winning side until someone reaches a certain amount
Declare a winner

---

**Implicit Requirements:**

Can only choose between 5 options

---

**Clarifying Questions:**

1.
2.
3.

---

**Mental Model:**

Introduce game
Ask how many games they'd like to play
  Best 2/3, 3/5, 4/7, etc
generate computer choice
ask user for choice
  validate choice
check if computer's choice is included in user choice's key value
  if it does, return win
check if computer choice is the same as user choice
  if it is, return tie
Otherwise

Data Structure

Hash = choice: [what choice wins against]
Array = Valid Choices (rock, paper, scissors, lizard, spock)

Algorithm

Print welcome
print How many best of? (only odd #s)
best of = get input
  validate number
    must be positive
    must be odd
    must be an integer
Round counter = 0

LOOP START
Round + 1
print Round #
CPU choice = Random valid choice
player choice = get Input
  validate choice
    valid choices include?
IF hash[player choice] includes computer choice
  WIN
  player count +1
  BREAK IF count == best of
ELSIF player choice == computer choice
  Tie
ELSE
  LOSE
  computer count +1
  BREAK IF count == best of
LOOP END

print GRAND CHAMPION
print play again?
decision = get Input
  validate y/n input
BREAK if no

print closing
